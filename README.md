# Chirp-O-Matcher
An Audio Matcher application in MATLAB. It uses a simple audio fingerprint algorithm to match the call of an unknown bird to databased known bird calls in the hope of identifying the unknown bird. This application was created as a final project for CS489 001 (Computational Audio, W16) taught by Richard Mann at the University of Waterloo.

**To Run:**
run chirp_o_matcher.m

Please note this project is a POC to represent audio fingerprint matching. It uses a small database of 10 bird calls. All audio used for testing and POC purposes is from http://www.avisoft.com/.
